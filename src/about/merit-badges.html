                You can learn about sports, crafts, science, trades, business, and future careers as you earn merit
                badges. There are more than 130 merit badges. Any Boy Scout may earn a merit badge at any time. You
                don’t need to have had rank advancement to be eligible.

            <p>
                Talk to Scoutmaster Johnny Chen about your interest in earning a merit badge. Read the requirements of
                the merit badges you think might interest you. Choose one to earn. Johnny Chen will give you a signed
                merit badge application (the "blue card") and the name and contact information of a merit badge
                counselor. These individuals have special knowledge in their merit badge subjects and are interested in
                helping you.

            <p>
                Get in touch with the merit badge counselor and tell them that you want to earn the merit badge. The
                counselor may ask to meet you to explain what is expected and to start helping you complete the
                requirements. You should also discuss work that you have already started or possibly completed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unless otherwise specified, work for a requirement can be started at any time. Ask your counselor to
                help you learn the things you need to know or do. You should obtain and read the merit badge pamphlet on
                the subject.

            <p>
                When you are ready, call the counselor again to make an appointment. When you go take along the things
                you have made to meet the requirements. If they are too big to move, take pictures or have an adult tell
                in writing what you have done. The counselor will test you on each requirement to make sure you know
                your stuff and have done or can do the things required.

            <p>
                When the counselor is satisfied that you have met each requirement, they will sign your application (the
                "blue card"). Give the signed application to your unit leader so that your merit badge emblem can be
                secured for you.

                The current Boy Scout Requirements book is available from your local Scouting merchandise distributor.
                It may also be ordered online at www.scoutstuff.org. Merit badge requirements are revised as needed to
                reflect updated information and technology. Click here to view new and recently revised merit
                badges.

                You are expected to meet the requirements as they are stated—no more and no less. You must do exactly
                what is stated in the requirements. If it says "show or demonstrate", that is what you must do. Just
                telling about it isn’t enough. The same thing holds true for such words as "make", "list", "in the
                field", and "collect", "identify", and "label".
